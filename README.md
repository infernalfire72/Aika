## Aika -- osu!Akatsuki's Discord bot.

Hello! However you happened to stumble upon this repository, welcome!

Aika is osu!Akatsuki's discord bot, written in python mostly for some programming practice.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.6
- Requirements (pip3 install -r requirements.txt)

## How to set up Aika.
As of version 4.35, I will no longer be providing support in setting up Aika.

I update and run this bot for the sole purpose of maintaining Akatsuki, and while setup has always been simple and straight forward, I have reached a point in the code where most of the features will only ever be used in my exact use case.

TL;DR: It's better for you to write your own.
